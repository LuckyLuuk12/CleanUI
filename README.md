# CleanUI

# What, why, how?
CleanUI is a huge and utterly complex scss package that provides me my basic styles for my projects.
Feel free to use it, but please do not copy it and claim it as your own.
```npm
npm install @kablan/clean-ui --save
```
# Usage
```scss
/* // Optionally override default variables from /scss/_variables.scss
$primary-
 */

// Import the CleanUI styles
@use "~@kablan/clean-ui/styles/index" as *;
```
